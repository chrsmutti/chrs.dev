I’ve decided to start something I’ve been meaning to start for a long time now:
**developing a profitable business**. Now, that’s a _tough_ job, and probably
doomed to fail, like a lot of the others, but at least I’ll try to make it
enjoyable for myself.

Yesterday, I wrote the first few lines of a project that will probably take
months of my time, and I’m actually looking forward to it. I’ve started by
writing a simple API that will be the backbone of the service, and to that task
I chose [Go](https://golang.org/) as a language, using [GCP’s Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/)
as a deploy environment. I’ve been testing Google’s platform for some days now,
and learning Go in the meantime and thought it would be a nice idea to use
something I enjoy.

Today I decided to sit down and think about the business model, only had a
couple of hours of free time, so decided to write something on Trello, and plan
the next steps, and decided last time to write this post, as a way of peer
pressuring myself, whenever this is out on the internet, it makes it all the
more **real**, and I think I _like_ it that way.

#### Let’s do this.
