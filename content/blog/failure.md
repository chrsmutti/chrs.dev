If you've been reading along, you should've noted that a month ago I wrote about
doing something new, starting a long-lasting project...

Failure is something I've learned to deal with, if you want to actually achieve
something someday, you will fail **a lot**, that's the mentality I try to take
with me. Whenever I drop something, I get a feeling of _despair_, of having wasted
time with something I wasn't able to keep going, but then I stop, and **think**.

Thinking about everything I learned with the project, the stuff I had to research,
the joy of doing something new, and the drive I had at the beginning. That time
was not actually wasted, life is made of failures, if you never fail, that means
you _never tried_ (or you're very lucky `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`).

My latest endeavour was actually cut short for a lack of interest by my part on
the subject, I chose something too close to my comfort zone, and tried to develop
a product that I did not find all that useful. If the creator of the project
can't find use to its own creation, it probably means it _sucked_. So, let's kick
the ball ahead (loosely translating a brazilian idiom and making no sense), and
try again. This time, with something I enjoy, would use, and is challenging
enough to not bore me to death while developing it. To be honest, odds are I'll
drop it, or it'll fail after I release it, but I'm looking forward to it, and
all the new things I'll **learn** in the process.
