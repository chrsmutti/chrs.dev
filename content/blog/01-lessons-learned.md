I've been interested and learning programming for most of my life, since I was
11 years old tinkering with
[RPG Maker](https://www.google.com/search?q=rpg+maker+xp&tbm=isch) and dreaming
of being a full time game developer.

Fast-forward **12 years in the future**, two years into the best job I could
ever hope for, a lot learned along the way and a lot more to learn in the
future. Two years might not seem like a lot, but working for a startup made a
lot of difference, being exposed to new technologies and having people to
support me while I was learning.

## Knowing that you don't know

Looking back with the power of hindsight my biggest lesson was that **there is**
**so much I don't actually know**. At that time I had been programming for 10
years, _if you call the first few years as actually programming_, I had tested
the waters with Java, C, C++ and occasionally web development.

The main focus of most of my time learning was to create a game that I would
enjoy and call mine, quite common among gamers that go into programming. But a
mistake I repeated time and time again was to doubt my own abilities. I would
start over **100 times**, trying to find a better solution, watched _hundreds_
of videos and tutorials, but always beginner level, and that was my biggest
mistake, not exposing myself to more advanced programming made me stagnant for a
long time.

The tipping point of my programming career came in the form of **Open Source**
**software**, two years into my undergrad I enrolled in a program to "foster
open source software development", that was the first time I had to tackle a
codebase larger than a dozen files, with a clear goal and being exposed to code
that wasn't written by me. A couple months after that I landed my first _real_
programming job.

## Knowing how to search what you don't know

One of the most important tools of the job has to be Google (_or DDG!_), but
it's one of the hardest to actually get it right, **knowing what and how to**
**ask something** is actually more important than trying, and failing, to know
everything by heart, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of tasks that are
deeply ingrained in your memory and you will be able to correctly execute them
till the end of your life, but _the rest you should google_.

So, **how do you look for something online**? My first instinct when I try to
find something is to actually find _someone_ that went through the problem I'm
having right now and how they fixed it, most likely ending up reading a question
in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). The search query could be either
the error message or an imagination of how that question would be asked by
somebody else, like
["how to pad strings in javascript?"](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+pad+strings+in+javascript&oq=how+to+pad+strings+in+javascript).
These types of questions will most likely yield better result when you know very
well **what you're trying to accomplish**, and sometimes knowing lingo, and
that's the _hardest_ part.
